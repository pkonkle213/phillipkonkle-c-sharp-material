# Build me a product page worthy of TE Bugz

You are being forced against your will to make a product page for a fictitious software bug management application called "TE Bugz".

This page should look professional and inviting to potential customers.

You may design this mobile-first or desktop-first.

**At the end of class, you will demo this to your instructor and the rest of your class.**

## Step 1: Sketch out your layout.

Draw a simple and crude box layout on a piece of paper, whiteboard, or Microsoft Paint

Plan places where you might use grid or flex since that will impact the HTML you build

Start thinking about colors and accent colors

## Step 2: Add content to the page in HTML tags

Now put some simple content onto your page by adding the appropriate HTML elements. You may make up your own content or you may use some or all of the content from the appendix at the bottom of this document.

Your focus is less on the content and more on having something to arrange and style later on.

The images folder has some images already, but you may pull any image you want from Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/software-bug

**Keep in mind how you plan on arranging things later on since Grid and Flex can only arrange direct children**

If you include links, it doesn't matter that what you set their `href` to doesn't exist, since we just care about styling and arrangement today.

## Step 3: Pick colors and add some basic styling to the page

Pick a set of 2 - 5 colors that you plan to use for styling. See https://coolors.co/ for a cool online color scheme generator

I recommend at least one of these colors be white since the logos I provided have white backgrounds.

Set the background color, foreground color, and font family.

## CHECK-IN POINT

Have someone from your team tell your instructor that you've finished step 3 and share how you're doing.

## Step 4: Arrange your content in grid or flex layouts

Build out the layout you sketched earlier. This is going to take more time than you might expect.

## CHECK-IN POINT

Have someone from your team tell your instructor that you've finished step 4 and share how you're doing.

## Step 5: Improve your styling

Play around with accent headers / sidebars / footers, different font colors in certain places, alignment, and padding as you look to find a look you enjoy.

If you get stumped, look at some professional bug or issue management software application websites for inspiration. https://www.google.com/search?q=bug+management+software&oq=bug+management+software may give you some inspiration.

## Step 6: Handle different screen resolutions

Add `@media` queries to your CSS file to handle different resolutions than the one you designed the application for. Ensure the final application looks acceptable on desktop, tablet, and mobile displays.

## CHECK-IN POINT

Have someone from your team tell your instructor that you've finished the core project.

# Appendix: Sample Content

Feel free to use some, all, or none of this content as you build out your site

## Slogan

> Because quality is optional

## Paragraphs

Time and time again we talk to stressed-out students and software engineers who respond to questions of software quality with "I don't have time for that!" or "quality is someone else's problem" or "sir, this is a Wendy's".

Well, we at TE Bugz hear you loud and clear. Your quality problems are our priority! Will we help you resolve the never-ending stream of bugs? No, but we're sure going to help monetize it!

Just send us regular installments of large chunks of money and you too can track bugs and feature requests you have no likelihood of addressing at any point in time. We'll provide helpful charts and graphs to help illustrate just how much trouble your organization is in and why you should "just burn it all to the ground" (to quote one senior engineer we spoke with).

That's why we introduced TE Bugz: because your quality problems are our livelihood.
