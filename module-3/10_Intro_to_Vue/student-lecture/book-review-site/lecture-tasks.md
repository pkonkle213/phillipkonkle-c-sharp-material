We need to do the following things:

## Components and Templates

Add a review-list component with the following things:

-[ ] Header with "Product Reviews for MY_PRODUCT_NAME_HERE"

-[ ] Placeholder text to display the search text and minimum rating

## Binding

-[ ] Add pieces of data to the model

## V-For

-[ ] Add a template for a single review in the HTML. Hard-coded data is fine for now
-[ ] Add a piece of data for the reviews
-[ ] Use v-for to change the single review to multiple reviews
-[ ] Set the properties of each review in the template
-[ ] Use v-bind:class to specify which classes should be applied
-[ ] Use v-bind:title or v-bind:id to illustrate other aspects of v-bind

## Computed

-[ ] Add a computed section
-[ ] Calculate the number of reviews
-[ ] Display the number of reviews in the header
-[ ] Calculate the average per review
-[ ] Display the average per review
-[ ] If we feel like it, chop off long decimals from the average
